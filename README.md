## Vue Application
This is simple website built on Vue Js. It simply has compnents of header, footer and four different routes and respective pages.

I used data from CatAPI to display different breeds of cats and some basic information about that particular breed. I manually created dataset for this web application instead of fetching directly from the API. 

I used: 
> templating,
> component-specific styling,
> property binding,
> attribute binding
> v-for Directive
> vue-router
