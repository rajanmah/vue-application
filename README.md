## Vue Application
This is simple website built on Vue Js and composition API. It simply has compnents of header, footer and four different routes and respective pages.

I used data from CatAPI to display different breeds of cats and some basic information about that particular breed. I manually created dataset for this web application instead of fetching directly from the API. 

I used: 
1. templating,
2. component-specific styling,
3. property binding,
4. attribute binding,
5. v-for Directive,
6. vue-router,
7. scoped CSS
